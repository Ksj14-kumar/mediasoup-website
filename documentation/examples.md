### versatica/mediasoup-demo

**Project:** [https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup-demo](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup-demo)

This is the "official" mediasoup demo made by mediasoup authors. Said that, we (the authors) don't want this demo to become the "mediasoup reference" and encourage developers to read the API documentation instead.

The **mediasoup-demo** has a client side web application and a server side Node.js application:

* The client side is a [React](https://reactjs.org) application that uses [mediasoup-client](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup-client) and [protoo-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protoo-client) among other libraries.
* The server side is a Node.js application that uses [mediasoup](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup) and [protoo-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protoo-server).
* [protoo](https://protoo.versatica.com) is a JavaScript library for both, client and server sides, that provides an easy way for clients to connect via WebSocket to a shared room. The API offers request/response transactions and notifications in both directions.
  - As an alternative (there are many) readers may be more used to [socket.io](https://socket.io).
